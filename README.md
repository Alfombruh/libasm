# libasm project

This project is a little library done in asm using the Intel Syntax and only writting in 64bits ASM </br>
I still need to understand what this means</br>

In this project I will need to recreate this functions in ASM: </br>

1) strlen as ft_strlen </br>
2) strcpy as ft_strcpy </br>
3) strcmp as ft_strcmp </br>
4) write as ft_write </br>
5) read as ft_read </br>
6) strdup as ft_strdup </br>

# TO-DO List

## Find what ASM Intel Syntax means
Well pretty easy question

## Find what 64bits ASM means
Guess this is just what the typical 86_64x or however is written means and prolly has to do with the max size of a variable

## Find an assembler
In assembly there is not such thing as a compiler, what appears that you do with the code is "to assemble it". </br>

So first I gotta understand what assembling means and does behind and then I shall find one to use </br>

## Find a way to compile a .a file from an assembly function 
Currently I dont know how to create a .a file from a .s file</br>
I should also learn how to create .o files from a .s file. But we'll see</br>

## Find a way to call a .s function from a .c file
I dont have the slightest clue about how to call a function thats inside a .s file from a .c file, so gl with this

## Learn how to properly code in assembly and all that :)
